# Pattern Making Techniques

## Fundamental Pattern Construction

### Basic Slopers (Blocks)
Foundation patterns that serve as the base for all garment designs:

#### Bodice Block
- **Front Bodice**: Includes neckline, shoulder, armhole, side seam, and waist
- **Back Bodice**: Features center back seam, shoulder blades, and armhole shaping
- **Sleeve Block**: Cap, elbow, and wrist shaping for proper fit
- **Collar Block**: Stand and fall measurements for various collar styles

#### Skirt Block
- **Straight Skirt**: Basic rectangle with darts for shaping
- **A-Line Skirt**: Wider at hem for flared silhouette
- **Circular Skirt**: Full circle or semi-circle for maximum flare
- **Pencil Skirt**: Fitted through hip with minimal flare

#### Pant Block
- **Front Pant**: Includes rise, thigh, knee, and ankle shaping
- **Back Pant**: Features yoke, seat shaping, and back rise
- **Fly Front Construction**: Functional opening with proper overlap

### Dart Manipulation
Techniques for shaping flat fabric to fit three-dimensional bodies:

#### Basic Dart Types
- **Bust Darts**: Vertical darts from armhole to bust point
- **Waist Darts**: Horizontal darts for waist shaping
- **Shoulder Darts**: Diagonal darts for shoulder fitting
- **Elbow Darts**: Shaping for bent arm positions

#### Dart Equivalents
- **Pleats**: Multiple small darts creating soft shaping
- **Tucks**: Sewn darts creating decorative elements
- **Gathers**: Drawn thread techniques for fullness
- **Eased Seams**: Gradual shaping without visible darts

## Advanced Pattern Development

### Style Line Manipulation
Creating design features through pattern cutting and manipulation:

#### Yoke Constructions
- **Shoulder Yokes**: Separating upper bodice for design interest
- **Waist Yokes**: Creating high-waisted effects
- **Hip Yokes**: Adding fullness or shaping at hip level

#### Seam Line Variations
- **Princess Seams**: Vertical seams from shoulder to hem
- **Panel Seams**: Creating structured silhouettes
- **Godet Insertions**: Adding flare through triangular inserts
- **Box Pleats**: Structured pleats for volume

### Sleeve Variations
Complex sleeve constructions for different design aesthetics:

#### Basic Sleeve Types
- **Set-in Sleeves**: Traditional armhole insertion
- **Raglan Sleeves**: Diagonal shoulder seam
- **Kimono Sleeves**: Extended shoulder line
- **Bell Sleeves**: Flared lower sleeve

#### Cuff and Opening Treatments
- **Button Cuffs**: Functional and decorative closures
- **French Cuffs**: Double-layer formal cuffs
- **Elastic Casings**: Gathered sleeve openings
- **Placket Constructions**: Clean finished openings

## Draping Techniques

### Fabric Manipulation Methods
Transforming flat fabric into three-dimensional forms:

#### Basic Draping Principles
- **Grain Line Awareness**: Using fabric bias for stretch and drape
- **Pin and Clip Techniques**: Temporary fabric control
- **Steam and Press**: Shaping through moisture and heat
- **Marking Tools**: Tailor's chalk and tracing methods

#### Style-Specific Draping
- **Empire Waist**: High waistline with soft draping
- **Greek Goddess**: Asymmetrical draping techniques
- **Boho Chic**: Layered and textured draping
- **Modern Minimalist**: Clean, architectural draping
