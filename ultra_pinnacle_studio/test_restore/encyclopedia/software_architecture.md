# Software Architecture Encyclopedia

- Design Patterns: Architectural patterns - Structural organization of software systems. Examples: MVC, MVVM, Microservices, Event-Driven. Applications: Scalable application design.
- System Design: Large-scale system architecture - Distributed systems, load balancing, caching. Examples: CDN, Message queues, API gateways. Applications: High-traffic web applications.
- Database Design: Data architecture - Relational vs NoSQL, normalization, indexing. Examples: PostgreSQL schemas, MongoDB collections. Applications: Data-intensive applications.
- Cloud Architecture: Cloud-native design - Serverless, containers, orchestration. Examples: AWS Lambda, Docker, Kubernetes. Applications: Modern cloud deployments.
- Security Architecture: Secure system design - Authentication, authorization, encryption. Examples: OAuth2, JWT, SSL/TLS. Applications: Secure application development.
- Performance Architecture: High-performance systems - Caching, optimization, monitoring. Examples: Redis, APM tools, profiling. Applications: Performance-critical applications.
- Additional: Event Sourcing, CQRS, Domain-Driven Design. Applications: Complex business logic systems.
